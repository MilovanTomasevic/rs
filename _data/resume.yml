    Sve o meni može se svesti na jednu recenicu, pokrene me ideja, koju jako želim i radim predano da je ostvarim. Potpuno mi je nevažno šta sve treba savladati. Inspirise me vizija koju sledim, sve ostalo mi je zanemarljivo. Samo gledam šta jos imam da uradim i koliko sam daleko od cilja, i to je to. Sve to me jako usrećuje i osećam se zivim. 
    Odbio sam da živim sa ne moze, i tačka. Zato što može, samo je potrebno izaći iz svog okvira, upotrebiti druge resurse, upoznati druge ljude, ovladati novim znanjima i veštinama. 
    Potrebno je prevazilaziti i raditi na tome posvećeno. I sve ce biti, ne odmah, ne sutra, ali će biti.

    website: "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322266423_Adaptive_fuzzy_model_for_determination_of_quality_assessment_services_in_supply_chain"
    summary: "The problem that is being addressed in this paper is to improve the services provided by company and achieve better communication among companies in the supply chain. Therefore, a qualitative assessment of the service has been required. This service is characterized by a group of parameters, which are often inaccurately estimated values as well as its importance for the evaluation system. This is often the result of assessor ́s uncertainty, variability of conditions, etc. Therefore, in the context of AM4SCM (Adaptive Model for Supply Chain Management) a mathematical model for evaluating the quality of services has been developed (FAM4QS - Fuzzy Aggregation Method for Quality Service) which is based on the fuzzy arithmetic. By selecting different values for the degrees of fuzzy power mean, which are used for evaluation of parameters or groups of parameters of the system and the service also, contribute to a better assessment and it is due to the varying nature of the parameters. The observed model was simulated on 17 supply chains on the territory of the Republic of Serbia. Service quality assessment is carried out on the basis of data from the user requirements - participants of supply chains binding the so-called fuzzy aggregation function."

    summary: "Implementing the best practice in IT services organization could be done with support of the of the third party solutions (i.e. CA tools). However, these tools do require significant investments and continuous specialized support. In cost / benefit analysis for small to medium sized companies it might be hard to justify these expenses. In this paper the emphases is given to the modeling of the Services desk solution that could be implemented using existing tools that company already posses (i.e. e-mail system, office tools, document management system, etc.)."

      Dear Sir or Madame,<br>
      With this letter I would like to give the recommendation for Milovan Tomasevic to any potential employer, or international studies scholarship sponsor/fond. 
      Milovan is highly motivated, enthusiastic, energetic, and smart young man, that I had an opportunity to work with the last few years. He was my Teaching Assistant on Project Management courses conducted with Software and Information Technology students. Everything that was needed to support students' practical assignments and practical and written exams preparations Milovan was able to achieve with a high level of quality and a minimum level of direct supervision. 
      I was his Mentor on his Master thesis, "Modelling Systems for Users' Requests Management Based on ITIL", where he successfully designed (at a conceptual level) a model of the ITIL based Users' Requests management system regardless of implementation tool specifics. We have also published a paper related to results from this thesis. 
      Milovan has successfully passed exams conducted by myself at Doctoral studies related to IT Services and Resources Management. 
      Finally, I would also stress out that giving support for Milovan's knowledge grow in the IT field here and abroad would be a secure investment that would be paid back very fast. 
      For any further information or details regarding Milovan please do not hesitate to contact me.

      Milovan is a rare talent. His passion, integrity, and work ethic are why he is the absolute best at what he does.
      Milovan is really someone who love his job !!! He is very smart and sociable. We can count on him !
      He thoughtlessly offered us his time and his experience giving us the opportunity to build a real business, I doubt we would have been able to achieve so much in so little time if it was not for his input.
      I really admired his dedication to it: he always responded to my correspondence with minimum amount of time, but you could still clearly see that he had gone deep into the subject.
      I would recommend Milovan to anyone who is looking for a selfless and experienced business contact.
      It was an honor to work for Milovan, and I look forward to crossing paths again.

      I am privileged to write in support of my dear friend and student, Milovan Tomašević. Milovan studied in my classroom for close to two years, during which time I witnessed his tremendous growth and development. This development came not only in the area of English language, but in maturity and character as well. In our work outside the classroom he has shown great knowledge in IT and project management which makes him a valuable asset for companies that deal with these topics.
